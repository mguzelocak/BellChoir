Bell Choir multithreaded program that uses .txt files to play music. reading method
detects the invalid songs and does not play them and tells the user what is wrong with the file.
Each distinct note is used by the Member.java class and only by that member.
The contractor only assigns these notes to individual members after the code is from a text file.

The hardest part of this project is again like the previous project,
making sure threads or Members do not play the music at the same time.
Also, making sure to catch all the code was really hard.
